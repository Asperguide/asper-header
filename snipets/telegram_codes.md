### **Example of a telegram-style sentence**

```
STOP YOUR MSG RCVD BT PLEASE SEND NR OF FILES END
```

Which reads in normal English as:

> “Your message received. Please send number of files.”

---

You can use these abbreviations to give your Asperguide comment headers a **vintage telegraph style**, like:

```
+=== BEGIN Asperguide =================+
MSG: File auto-signed STOP
R: Developer John N: Team END
+=== END Asperguide =================+
```

---

If you want, I can **draft a “telegram-style Asperguide comment template”** that incorporates **BEGIN / STOP / END sections**, and uses abbreviations in a way that still reads clearly to a developer, keeping the telegraph aesthetic.

Do you want me to do that?
