/**
 * @file querier.ts
 * @brief User interaction utility for VS Code input dialogs and prompts
 * @author Henry Letellier
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @date 2025
 * 
 * This module provides a comprehensive user interaction system for the AsperHeader extension,
 * offering standardized methods for collecting user input, presenting choices, and confirming
 * actions through VS Code's native UI components. All interactions include proper error
 * handling and internationalized messaging.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Text input dialogs with customizable options
 * - Quick pick selection lists for multiple choices
 * - Yes/No confirmation dialogs with localized buttons
 * - Comprehensive error handling with logging
 * - Singleton pattern for consistent instance access
 * - Integration with extension's internationalization system
 * - Async/await support for modern JavaScript patterns
 * 
 * User Interface Components:
 * - **Input Box**: Single-line text input with validation options
 * - **Quick Pick**: Selection from predefined list of options
 * - **Confirmation**: Binary yes/no choice dialogs
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * All user interaction methods include try-catch blocks with proper error logging
 * and graceful degradation. Failed interactions return undefined rather than
 * throwing exceptions, allowing calling code to handle missing input appropriately.
 * 
 * Usage Patterns:
 * - Header description collection from users
 * - File operation confirmations
 * - Configuration option selection
 * - Multi-language prompt presentation

/**
 * @class Query
 * @brief Singleton user interaction manager for VS Code UI components
 * 
 * Provides standardized methods for user interaction through VS Code's native UI
 * components. Implements singleton pattern to ensure consistent behavior and state
 * across the extension. All methods are async and include comprehensive error handling.
 * 
 * Design Patterns:
 * - **Singleton**: Single instance ensures consistent UI behavior
 * - **Facade**: Simplifies VS Code UI API with extension-specific methods
 * - **Error Handling**: All methods gracefully handle failures and log errors
 * - **Internationalization**: Integrates with getMessage for localized prompts
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * VS Code UI operations are inherently single-threaded, and this class maintains
 * no mutable state, making it safe for concurrent access across extension modules.

     * @brief Displays an input dialog to collect text from the user

     * @param options Optional VS Code InputBoxOptions for advanced configuration
     * @return Promise resolving to user input string or undefined if cancelled/failed
     * 
     * Presents a single-line text input dialog using VS Code's native showInputBox.
     * The dialog includes the provided prompt text and supports all VS Code
     * InputBoxOptions for advanced customization (validation, password mode, etc.).
     * 
     * Features:
     * - Customizable prompt text for user guidance
     * - Full VS Code InputBoxOptions support (validation, placeholder, etc.)
     * - Comprehensive error handling with logging
     * - Graceful failure handling (returns undefined on error)
     * 
     * Common Use Cases:
     * - Collecting file descriptions for headers
     * - Getting user-specified file purposes
     * - Input validation with custom validation functions
     * - Password or sensitive information collection
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * If the input dialog fails to display or encounters an error, the method
     * logs the error details and returns undefined rather than throwing an exception.
     * 
     * Example Usage:
     * ```typescript
     * // Simple text input
     * const description = await query.input("Enter file description:");
     * 
     * // Input with validation
     * const name = await query.input("Enter name:", {
     *     validateInput: (value) => value.length > 0 ? null : "Name required"
     * });

     * 
     * Presents a quick pick selection dialog using VS Code's native showQuickPick.
     * Users can select from the provided list of options using keyboard navigation
     * or mouse interaction. Supports filtering and searching within the option list.
     * 
     * Features:
     * - Multiple option presentation with search/filter capability
     * - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, type-to-filter)
     * - Customizable placeholder text for user guidance
     * - Comprehensive error handling with logging
     * - Graceful cancellation handling
     * 
     * Common Use Cases:
     * - Comment style selection for different languages
     * - Configuration option selection
     * - File type or format selection
     * - Feature toggle selection
     * 
     * User Experience:
     * The dialog appears as a dropdown list with search functionality. Users can:
     * - Type to filter options
     * - Use arrow keys to navigate
     * - Press Enter to select
     * - Press Escape to cancel
     * 
     * Error Handling:
     * If the quick pick dialog fails to display or encounters an error, the method
     * logs the error details and returns undefined rather than throwing an exception.
     * 
     * Example Usage:
     * ```typescript
     * const commentStyles = ["//", "/*", "#", "--"];
     * const selected = await query.quickPick(
     *     commentStyles, 
     *     "Select comment style for this language"

     * @return Promise resolving to true if user selected "Yes", false otherwise
     * 
     * Presents a binary choice confirmation dialog using localized "Yes" and "No"
     * options. The method uses the extension's internationalization system to
     * display buttons in the user's preferred language.
     * 
     * Features:
     * - Localized Yes/No buttons based on user's VS Code language
     * - Clear binary choice presentation
     * - Integration with extension's message system
     * - Consistent confirmation pattern across extension
     * 
     * Internationalization:
     * Button labels are automatically localized using getMessage() with keys:
     * - "quickPickYes" for the affirmative option
     * - "quickPickNo" for the negative option
     * 
     * Return Values:
     * - **true**: User explicitly selected "Yes" option
     * - **false**: User selected "No" or cancelled the dialog (ESC, clicking outside)
     * 
     * Common Use Cases:
     * - Confirming file overwrite operations
     * - Asking permission to create missing headers
     * - Confirming destructive actions
     * - User consent for automatic operations
     * 
     * User Experience:
     * The dialog presents as a quick pick with two options. The prompt text
     * appears as the placeholder, and users can select using mouse or keyboard.
     * Cancelling the dialog (ESC key) is treated as a "No" response.
     * 
     * Example Usage:
     * ```typescript
     * const shouldProceed = await query.confirm(
     *     "No header found. Would you like to create one?"
     * );
     * 
     * if (shouldProceed) {
     *     // User confirmed, proceed with header creation
     * }
     * ```

        return selection === yes;
    }

/**
 * @brief Convenience singleton export for direct access to Query functionality
 * @export Primary interface for user interaction throughout the extension
 * 
 * Pre-instantiated singleton instance of the Query class, ready for immediate use
 * throughout the extension. This export eliminates the need to access Query.instance
 * repeatedly and provides a more convenient API for common user interaction scenarios.
 * 
 * Usage Benefits:
 * - **Simplified Import**: Direct access without singleton getter calls
 * - **Consistent Interface**: Same instance used across all extension modules
 * - **Reduced Boilerplate**: No need for Query.instance.method() calls
 * - **IntelliSense Support**: Full method completion and documentation
 * 
 * Recommended Usage Pattern:
 * ```typescript
 * import { query } from './querier';
 * 
 * // Direct method access
 * const userInput = await query.input("Enter description:");
 * const selection = await query.quickPick(["option1", "option2"], "Choose:");
 * const confirmed = await query.confirm("Proceed with operation?");
 * ```
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * This export references the singleton instance, which is thread-safe for
 * VS Code's single-threaded JavaScript environment. All UI operations are
 * queued through VS Code's event system automatically.
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * All methods accessed through this export include the same comprehensive
 * error handling as the Query class methods, returning undefined for failed
 * operations rather than throwing exceptions.
